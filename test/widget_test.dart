// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility in the flutter_test package. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

// Note: The original widget_test.dart references 'package:zamir/main.dart'
// but the package is named 'zamir_app' in pubspec.yaml.
// Also, the main.dart doesn't export a simple MyApp with counter functionality.
// This test file is a placeholder until proper widget tests are implemented.

void main() {
  testWidgets('Placeholder test', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // This is a placeholder test.
    // Proper widget tests should be implemented for specific screens.
